<span class="whatisnanny-all-questions-text">What is a
NannyShare?</span><br />

<span class="whatisnanny-answers-of-questions">
A nannyshare is precisely what it sounds like: when two or more families get together to share the services of a single nanny. Typically, the families will live near each other and then work out the logistics, including nanny compensation and benefits (including vacation days, sick days, etc.), nanny work hours, who will “host” the nannyshare, and provisions regarding the process for one family to withdraw from the nannyshare.


</span><br />

<span class="whatisnanny-all-questions-text">What are the
advantages of a NannyShare?</span><br />

<span class="whatisnanny-answers-of-questions">
Nannies offer the most flexibility when it comes to non-family provided child care but often at the greatest cost. At its best, nannyshares offer the best of both worlds, providing families involved much of the same flexibility as having a nanny while sharing the expenses. They provide care for your child with a stable and consistent care giver, they limit the number of children with whom your child is exposed thus limiting their exposure to germs and lowering their risk of sickness, expose your child with a similarly aged peer with whom to play and develop a close friendship, and give parents flexibility in pick up and drop-off times by eliminating fees for late pickups. 
A nannyshare also provides extra hands to deal with back-up childcare should the nanny get sick. In a regular nanny or small daycare situation, a last minute call that the childcare provider is sick can lead parents to a last minute scramble for back-up care that will likely greatly disrupt the plans of at least one parent. In a nannyshare, the parents will have additional parent(s) to draw from to step into the caregiver role and thus limit the disruptions that the inevitable sickness will cause. 


</span><br />

<span class="whatisnanny-all-questions-text">Are there any
downsides?</span><br />

<span class="whatisnanny-answers-of-questions">
For a nannyshare to be successful, the families involved need to make sure they have compatible parenting styles. Philosophical parenting differences in things like television, homework, housekeeping, and whether the nanny should drive the children could all strain the relationship and lead to problems. In addition, there are family logistical issues that need to be considered including coordinating days off and vacation schedules for the nanny. Also, a change in circumstances with one family could lead to a withdrawal and leave the other family abandoned.

Another risk is the financial one. A nannyshare relationship is a business relationship and the failure of one partner to pay their portion of the nannyshare bill greatly impacts the other partner: they will either have to pay for their partners portion or risk alienating their nanny.

<span class="whatisnanny-all-questions-text">I found a Nannyshare
Partner! What should we be considering?</span><br />

<span class="whatisnanny-answers-of-questions">
There are a lot of logistics and administrative items that need to be worked out between the families participating in a nannyshare. We recommend that you decide ahead of time your stance on these issues and to enter into a written contract of some sort to memorialize the agreement. By openly considering and communicating all expectations ahead of time, there will be no surprises or disagreements in the future relating to the issues. We have created a list of items to consider below, but this list is by no means comprehensive and partners should consider their particular facts and circumstances when determining what issues to discuss with their partner.
<ol class="list-of-question-ordered">
<li>Is the host’s home childproof? If you are an earthquake prone area, is the host’s home seismically retrofitted to be safe for the children?</li>
<li>Does the host’s homeowner insurance cover injury to the nanny and the children? Is the amount of the homeowner’s insurance in sufficient amounts to make everyone comfortable? If not, who should pay the increase in premiums?</li>
<li>What will the children eat?</li>
<li>Where will the children nap? Will the “guest” families bring a pack-n-play to leave indefinitely at the hosts house?</li>
<li>How will the cost of food and supplies used in the home be divided?</li>
<li>How will big nanny relationship decisions be decided (i.e. pay raises, nanny vacation request approvals, benefits etc.)?</li>
<li>What type of nanny do we want (age, experience, language abilities, religion, cooking abilities, etc.)?</li>
<li>How much will you pay the nanny and what benefits will you offer (e.g. vacation days, holiday schedule, sick days, health insurance, social security and medicare)?</li>
<li>What process will you follow to pay the nanny, administer benefits and keep records, and who will be in charge of those functions?</li>
<li>How will you deal with nanny illnesses?</li>
<li>How will you deal with child illnesses?</li>
<li>What length of notice or pay will be required for one family to withdraw from the nannyshare?</li>

</ol>

<span class="whatisnanny-all-questions-text">How do I find a
Nanny? </span><br />

<span class="whatisnanny-answers-of-questions">
There are numerous nanny agencies to be found on the internet with lots of information about the process of hiring a nanny. We believe that the internet adequately provides nanny hiring services and as such we suggest that you work with one of them.
